# Mistral Fine-Tuning Project

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the Mistral language model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and tools from the Hugging Face ecosystem. It includes data preprocessing, model configuration, training, and evaluation steps to customize the language model for specific downstream tasks.

## Features

- Fine-tuning of the Mistral language model using LoRA.
- Integration with Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries.
- Efficient model training with 4-bit quantization for resource optimization.
- Support for training with the `trl` library for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback).

## Requirements

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8 or later
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `peft`
- `trl`
- Other standard libraries: `time`, `os`

### Installation

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets peft trl
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load and preprocess datasets using the Hugging Face `datasets` library.
   - Customize the `Dataset` object to align with the model's input requirements.

2. **Model Configuration**
   - Configure LoRA parameters using `peft`:
     ```python
     from peft import LoraConfig
     lora_config = LoraConfig(r=8, lora_alpha=32, target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"], lora_dropout=0.05)
     ```
   - Prepare the Mistral model for 4-bit training:
     ```python
     from peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training
     model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)
     ```

3. **Training**
   - Use `SFTTrainer` from `trl` to fine-tune the model.
   - Define training arguments:
     ```python
     from transformers import TrainingArguments
     training_args = TrainingArguments(
         output_dir="./results",
         num_train_epochs=3,
         per_device_train_batch_size=8,
         save_steps=10,
         save_total_limit=2,
         logging_dir="./logs"
     )
     ```

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using custom metrics or existing evaluation datasets.
