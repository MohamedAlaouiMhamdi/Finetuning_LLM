# Mistral Fine-Tuning for Dialogue Summarization and Customer Support

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the Mistral-7B language model using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) to optimize the model for dialogue summarization and customer support tasks. By leveraging advanced parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, this project ensures high performance while maintaining resource efficiency.

## Features

- Fine-tuning of the Mistral-7B model for dialogue summarization and customer support.
- Utilization of QLoRA for efficient training and reduced computational overhead.
- Integration with Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries.
- Customizable training pipeline for various dialogue datasets.

## Requirements

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8 or later
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `peft`
- `trl`
- Other standard libraries: `time`, `os`

### Installation

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets peft trl
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**

   - Load and preprocess dialogue datasets using the Hugging Face `datasets` library.
   - Customize the `Dataset` object to align with the model's input requirements for summarization and support tasks.

2. **Model Configuration**

   - Configure QLoRA parameters using `peft`:
     ```python
     from peft import LoraConfig
     lora_config = LoraConfig(r=8, lora_alpha=32, target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"], lora_dropout=0.05)
     ```
   - Prepare the Mistral-7B model for quantized training:
     ```python
     from peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training
     model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)
     ```

   **Evaluation and Deployment**

   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model using custom metrics for summarization accuracy and response quality.
   - Deploy the model in HuggingFace
